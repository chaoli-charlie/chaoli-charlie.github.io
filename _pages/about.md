I am Charlie (Chao) Li, a PhD student in Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) advised by Dina Katabi. My research interests include developing Artificial Intelligence Systems for Healthcare, Wireless Communications, and Computer Vision. 

I obtained my Bachelors in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I graduated top of my department with the prestigious E.M. Williams Award, where I was advised by Swarun Kumar and Nancy Pollard. I also had the chance to serve as the President of Eta Kappa Nu, Sigma Chapter, the Electrical Engineering Honor Chapter of CMU.

<!-- I come from a family of researchers spanning across different fields in science, who inspired me to pursue impactful work in translational research. My family's influence has inspired me to view science research as a necessary social good requiring proper stewardship.  -->

Outside of research, I love to hike and explore nature. I also happen to be a huge sitcom nerd, and hold the (controversial) opinion that Community is the best sitcom ever made. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
