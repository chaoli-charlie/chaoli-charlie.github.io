I am Charlie (Chao) Li, a PhD student in Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) advised by Dina Katabi. My research interests include developing Artificial Intelligence Systems for Healthcare, Computer Vision, and Wireless Communications. 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, graduating at the top of my department and receiving the prestigious E.M. Williams Award. During my time at CMU, I had the privilege of being mentored by Professors Swarun Kumar and Nancy Pollard, and I also served as President of Eta Kappa Nu, Sigma Chapter, the university's Electrical Engineering Honor Society.

<!-- I come from a family of researchers spanning across different fields in science, who inspired me to pursue impactful work in translational research. My family's influence has inspired me to view science research as a necessary social good requiring proper stewardship.  -->

Outside of research, I love to hike and explore nature. I also happen to be a huge sitcom nerd, and hold the (controversial) opinion that Community is the best sitcom ever made. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
