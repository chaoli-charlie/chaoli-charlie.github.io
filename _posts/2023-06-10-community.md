A non-exhaustive ranking of Sitcoms. I have watched each of these sitcoms at least 3 times, each with a different perspective
in order to get a more objective evaluation.


#### Rankings
<ul>
    <li>Community</li>
    <li>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</li>
    <li>The Good Place</li>
    <li>Parks and Recreation</li>
    <li>Friends</li>
    <li>The Office</li>
</ul>

The key criteria to a successful sitcom lies in the techniques used to embed deeper themes.

<!-- Community -->
The TV show 'Community' truly stands out to me due to its remarkable portrayal of important themes like racial sensitivity, religious harmony, and mental health, all while maintaining its comedic essence. It lightly pokes at some controversial themes, but repects the audience enough to let them make their own independent and intellectual judgement on these issues. One theme that particularly resonated with me was how the character Abed subtly and consistently reminded the group that he was both of Polish and Arabic heritage, having been raised in the US. Despite this, the group largely characterized him as solely Arabic. This theme reflects the experiences of many first-generation immigrants, where individuals born and bred in their adopted country often feel as though they are still perceived as foreigners.

Overall, the show is lightheated and comforting. Some sitcoms have overbearing and annoying characters which can often be offputting. But 'Community' was especially good at reminding audiences that these characters are in a learning environment where their views and character can change, allowing the audiences to easily forgive the immaturity of characters. 

Key Scenes
Abed's wisdom shines through in his powerful statement: "When you really know who you are and what you like about yourself, changing for other people isn't such a big deal." This profound insight holds significant meaning, particularly for those navigating the journey of self-discovery in the midst of external criticism and peer pressure. Abed's words emphasize the crucial importance of prioritizing self-love and mental well-being above the desire for friendship and social acceptance. By truly understanding and appreciating our own identities, embracing our unique qualities, and knowing our self-worth, the pressure to conform or change for others diminishes. Abed's wisdom encourages individuals to establish a strong foundation of self-awareness and self-acceptance, fostering resilience in the face of external influences, and promoting a healthier approach to relationships and personal growth.

<!-- Brooklyn Nine Nine -->
Brooklyn Nine-Nine's exceptional portrayal of real societal issues during the late 2010s solidifies its status as one of the greatest television shows ever created. I rank it below Community as it occasionally contains liberal themes that may not resonate with all audiences. The character development of the main character, Jake, stands as a testament to the potential for personal growth even in adulthood. While the show presents an almost idealistic working environment in the precinct, it also emphasizes that humor can still thrive within the context of a workplace setting.

<!-- The Good Place -->
It is almost unfair to rate 'The Good Place', because the show leans more towards philosophy than situational comedy. Nevertheless, this show is perhaps the only sitcom out there with such a bold take on the meaning of life and eternal judgement, themes that often make people uncomfortable. 

Key Scene
Jason's compelling argument highlights the complexities of modern life, making it increasingly challenging to make morally sound decisions. He brings attention to the fact that individuals struggling to make ends meet often lack the necessary information or resources to prioritize ethically sourced products like fair trade tomatoes. His argument raises questions about the fairness of judgment based solely on the morality of one's decisions. It suggests that if there truly exists a "Good Place" and a "Bad Place," assessing an individual's intent might be a fairer measure than solely evaluating the morality of their choices. It is almost unironic for Jason to be the one to present one of the most thought-provoking philosophical arguments within the show- reminiscent of the biblical theme that foolish people shall shame the wise.
